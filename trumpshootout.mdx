A man fired “multiple shots” toward the stage during former President Donald J. Trump’s rally in Butler, Pa., on Saturday evening, killing one spectator and critically injuring two others, according to the Secret Service.

Mr. Trump was rushed off the stage, blood visible around his right ear. He was taken to a hospital, and the Secret Service said he was “safe.” The Secret Service also said its agents had killed the shooter, whom federal law enforcement officials identified as Thomas Matthew Crooks, a 20-year-old from Bethel Park, Pa.

Senior F.B.I. officials said on Sunday that agents were investigating the shooting as a possible domestic terrorism attack and assassination attempt.

Here’s what we know about the shooting.

The Former President
Mr. Trump ducked quickly after the shots began and as members of the crowd began to scream. Secret Service agents then rushed Mr. Trump off the stage. As he was escorted to his motorcade, Mr. Trump, whose face and right ear were bloodied, pumped his fist in a defiant gesture to the crowd.
He later said in a post on Truth Social, his social media platform, that he had been “shot with a bullet that pierced the upper part of my right ear.”

In his social media post, Mr. Trump wrote, “I knew immediately that something was wrong in that I heard a whizzing sound, shots, and immediately felt the bullet ripping through the skin. Much bleeding took place, so I realized then what was happening.”

He was taken to a hospital on Saturday and later flew to New Jersey, where was able to walk off his plane unaided and spent the night at his golf club.

The Suspected Shooter
The Secret Service said the shooter had fired “from an elevated position outside of the rally venue” before being killed by a sniper. An analysis by The New York Times suggested that the gunman fired eight shots.

In a statement, the F.B.I. identified the gunman as Thomas Matthew Crooks. He was employed as a dietary aide at Bethel Park Skilled Nursing and Rehabilitation, according to the administrator at the facility. He graduated with an associate degree from the Community College of Allegheny County two months ago, school officials said.

The shooter was also a member of the Clairton Sportsmen’s Club in greater Pittsburgh, which features a 200-yard rifle range, the club’s legal counsel said in a statement.

Law enforcement officials recovered an AR-15-type semiautomatic rifle from Mr. Crooks’s body. The F.B.I. said the weapon was legally purchased by the shooter’s father, but it was unclear on Sunday how the shooter gained possession of the firearm.

Among the gunman’s possessions, the authorities also discovered a “rudimentary” explosive device, which was sent to the F.B.I.’s lab in Quantico, Va., along with his phone and gun.

Law enforcement officials are investigating a motive in the attack and said that as of Sunday, there was nothing to indicate the shooter had mental health issues, and he so far has not been tied to any specific ideology. He’s believed to have acted alone, officials said.

The Casualties
Gov. Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania identified the man who was killed at the rally as Corey Comperatore, 50, a father of two daughters from Sarver, Pa., who worked at a plastic manufacturing company and was a volunteer firefighter. Mr. Comperatore was fatally shot in the head after he dove to cover family members who accompanied him to the rally, according to the governor.

The Pennsylvania State Police identified the two people who were critically injured as David Dutch, 57, of New Kensington, Pa., and James Copenhaver, 74, of Moon Township, Pa. Both patients were in critical but stable condition Sunday afternoon at Allegheny General Hospital in Pittsburgh, said Dan Laurent, a hospital spokesman.

Mr. Dutch is a longtime Trump supporter who has been working at Siemens for decades and was once a member of the Marine Corps., according to Jennifer Veri-Grazier, his sister. He had damage to his liver and ribs and was awaiting another surgery, she said.

Mr. Copenhaver was retired, according to Albert Quaye, a supervisor in Moon Township who met Mr. Copenhaver at a local board of supervisors meeting. Records show he was a registered Democrat. He is married with at least one son, friends said.

The Scene
The shooting happened as Mr. Trump was holding a large outdoor rally on the grounds of the Butler Farm Show in Butler, a town of 13,000 people about 34 miles north of Pittsburgh. Mr. Trump had been showing supporters a chart about the number of border crossings just minutes into his speech when the shots rang out. Attendees screamed, “Get down, get down!” and “Shots fired!” The Secret Service quickly cleared the press area, moved the crowd out and declared the area a crime scene. Some Trump supporters held hands and prayed and then chanted “U.S.A.!”
