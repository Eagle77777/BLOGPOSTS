I was earlier holding HDFC bank shares which I had purchased at an average price of around 1460 and sold them at a price of 1620 a peice, a profit of around 10 percent in about 3 months time. 
As soon as i liquidated my holdings in HDFC bank, i bought another stock called Man Industries. I have bought the stock at an average price of 383 ruppees and right now it is trading at 475 ruppees. So my money is up around 25% as of now in Man Industries! My money went up 25% in Man Industries in just about 1 or 2 weeks. So, God has been good in this year so far.
