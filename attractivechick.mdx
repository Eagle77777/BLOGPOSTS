Today's generation is much weaker compared to how humans used to be in the past!
Slaves in the old days used to fuckin work 14-16 hours a day working full shifts by the age of 16 in hot and cold weathers. The diet was not very adequate and living and health conditions were also poor. Yet they used to live their lives and work hard and used to work into old age and when they became too old to do hard labour, they used to do specialised work in their 70's. That is what human potential is. Mike Tyson used to workout for 10-12 hours a day, lots and lots of such examples of work ethic in all fields and places. The mind is the most important thing, mental strength is much, much more important than physical strength and that is what is missing in today's generation!
